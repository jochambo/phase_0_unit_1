# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

The biggest challenge of DBC will be the best use of the hours outside of class time.  Eight to five is easy.  It's finding the balance of rest, personal, and play time.  I realize that there will be no real balance to life during the months of DBC, but rest and recreation, however little, are still necessary for the learning process

In terms of techniques, I appreciate the focus on meditation.  As a Catholic this links very easily to the ancient practices of prayer, focused periods of time to reconnect to our Creator.  The key though is that this is not an empty time without voice or conversation.  For me, conversation with God, allows me to realign my priorities and re-engage in life when the craziness of life begins to creep in and overwhelm me.  While it is not empty time, it is also not time where I do all of the talking.  There is no requirement to speak at all.  Sometimes it helps to just listen.

"Confidence is just displayed ability."  The military was very useful in teaching a growth mindset according to this principle though we never used this term.  In flight school, I remember taping a life size version of the cockpit controls around me in my bathroom.  From the toilet I could visualize each step of the flight.  As I managed to learn to move through the checklists using these sheets of paper, touching the controls in time with my mental picture, I gained the confidence to then move on to the simulator and later to the plane.  Small wins add up to big accomplishments.  Today I'm learning about the interaction of CSS with my HTML.  From this I'll gain the confidence to program an entire web app.

I can appreciate the need to cultivate the "three most essential skills that a beginning programmer needs to know: Reading and Writing, Attention to Detail, Spotting Differences."  I can already see that Zed Shaw's advice is perfect for this new venture.

The article on counter-intuitive productivity was enlightening.  Jennie and I started a project as we prepared to exit the military when we realized there was just too much stuff in our house to put into storage for almost a year.  Thus was born the 300 project.  For the month of April we found 10 things each night around the house that we wanted to get rid of.  The simple rule was that once an item was added to the pile it was gone.  We couldn't pull it back out.  It was gone.  At the end we had a disastrous garage sale and then sent whatever was left to the various donation centers around our house.  Going micro as well as making a game out of the outcome made it easy to downsize.

I have also used these [action planners]("http://www.productiveflourishing.com/free-planners/") to help categorize time into things that have to happen at specific times and work on creative pursuits during dedicated periods.

I am finding a good flow right now during Phase 0 which allows me to get up a reasonable hour, attend Mass, eat breakfast and work on DBC materials until lunch.  Most afternoons are spent either on personal activities or if needed DBC until dinner when I start winding down and prepping for the next day.  I will say it does help to have a wife who is just as dedicated to this as I am and helps me keep on track.
