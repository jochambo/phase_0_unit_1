# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design aims to preserve design of a website across the hundreds of screen resolutions available.  It does this by allowing elements to scale or be eliminated based on available resolution.  It also seeks to prevent images from degrading as resolution is increased.  Of course I love the results of responsive design, though I can't say yet that I enjoy programming a site to be responsive.  I feel that as my skills with CSS improve, responsive design will become easier.

In some ways smartphones and tablets are the new printed webpages.  I can still remember printing webpages and squinting to read through the background image.  As we added print stylesheets we were responding to the need for people to be able to interact with the web however they chose - even on paper.  Now as even refrigerators are web-enabled, people have come to expect great design to come with the web.  

More than the fact that the blind are able to use the web, I'm amazed that it is pretty standardized and nearly unknown to the rest of the world what lengths web developers go to in making sure that everyone can use their sites.  When businesses cater to a disabled person in the real world the rest of us see the ramps, the service animal signs, etc.  In the digital world, these helps are invisible for the most part.  They work with a computer with accessibility features enabled and other peripherals.

Positioning drives me crazy.  I conceptually grasp that html is displayed from top to bottom and left to right.  But as soon as I move one object, it creates this dependancy that runs through my entire page.  I then feel the need to write dozens of lines of CSS to correct the issue.  Elements never seem to interact the way I expect, and then this week introduced the problems that browsers especially old ones induce.

The exercise of working through the responsive website was good since it forced me to go line by line through the HTML and CSS to try and understand how each line interacted with the browser.  And that's exactly what I did working from the final project and updating my practice file, trying different values when I didn't quite grasp the concept.  After a few hours, I think something is finally clicking.

I found this one site called [Flexible Math](http://responsv.com/flexible-math).  It allows you to quickly size elements in a div by giving a context width and adding your elements.  It outputs the CSS code for percentage widths with comments added.
