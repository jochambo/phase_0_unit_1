        <h1>Understanding Pair Programming</h1>
        <p>Pair programming is a way of programming that involves two people, a driver and a navigator, at a single computer.  We'll define the function of both below:</p>
      </section>
      <div class="compare">
          <section class="programmer">
            <h2>The Driver</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>is the programmer doing the typing</li>
              <li>is focused on the line being written and the syntax</li>
              <li>doesn't get too involved in the structure and planning</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="programmer">
            <h2>The Navigator</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>is the programmer that is focused on the big picture</li>
              <li>tries to predict future problems and make sure we don't get into situations that will bring us problems later on</li>
              <li>focuses on giving direction so the driver can focus on being efficient in writing the code</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
      </div>
      <section>
          <p>
          Pair programming approaches a problem as a team allowing quicker and more efficient solutions. While we were programming this page, we were able to catch syntax issues and solve problems that would otherwise take us a lot longer.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Neither Igor nor I had ever pair-programmed before.  While the finished product was simple, the discussion and the working relationship was great.  Given more time and more knowledge,who knows what we could have built.  I enjoyed not getting hung up on simple mistakes that seem to plague my learning process when I'm working alone.  The only real difficulty I noticed was remote pairing has some inherent issues since you can't really see each other, connections can drop and there are more opportunities for distraction.</p>
