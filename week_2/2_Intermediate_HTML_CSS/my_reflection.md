# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
>As a student, web standards make the on-ramp to being a developer much easier.  I can easily verify what is expected of me and avoid some of the pitfalls of being a beginner.  I can only imagine as a professional developer standards can be debated but once agreed upon make collaboration and workflow much better.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
>The standard structure is easy to follow although I still get tripped up by `<head>`, and `<header>`
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
>The new elements are welcome since they take the guesswork out of naming the most common divs.  They also shorten the code a bit since they act similarly to ids or classes without having to declare them.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
>The reset.css file helps to clear out the default styling of some HTML elements.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
>I've used Safari, Chrome, and Firefox by choice and Internet Explorer by force.  I have to say it drives me a bit crazy even as a user to see the site change from browser to browser.  I imagine my craziness will only increase as I begin to develop for all of these different browsers.
