# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
Based on my research, I am most influenced by designers that combine beauty that a user would want to interact with and functionality that doesn't hide the purpose of a site behind a lot of flourishes.  I am leaning towards a design that follows and serves function, enhancing it and improving the user's overall experience.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I enjoy user experience though some of the frustrations I encountered this week led me to swear off ever wanting to work in UX primarily.  
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
My first process of doing a very loose wireframe and not thinking through the implementation failed completely.  I soon found myself treading in a pretty murky pool of random CSS tags and HTML that had a bad case of div-itis.  I soon scrapped most of that work, made a more specific wireframe, and began to think through what HTML tags I would need and how CSS could help position each section.  There were still challenges but the biggest hurdles were in the past.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I would like to make the quote responsive without overlapping the links.  The site doesn't break down as gracefully as I would like.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I finally got around to understanding the display property and was able to use the techniques immediately.  I also played around with gradients on the horizontal rule.  I knew it was possible and just needed a bit of synax help to perfect it.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
