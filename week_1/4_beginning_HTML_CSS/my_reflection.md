* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The key point about HTML and CSS which I'm still trying to grasp is when to use each language.  HTML is used to markup a document and add meaning to all of the parts contained in a document.  CSS presents that information using color, size, and positioning.  Sometimes there's overlap.  For instance you can italicize text in both CSS and HTML, however in HTML you are assigning meaning (like when you are introducing jargon or a word from another language).  CSS just says "Look at me! I'm different!"
