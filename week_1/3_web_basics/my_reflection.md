## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Until today, I haven't had a clear grasp of some of the terminology I was coming across as I studied.  For instance, I have seen Integrated Development Environment (IDE) dozens of times with no idea that the term only describes the software which supports development.  I also learned about the differences between languages, libraries, and frameworks.

The resources about nameservers was mind-blowing.  You know the web is big, at least conceptually, but to see the actual numbers of IP addresses available and to understand the organization that goes into assigning addresses to domain names is fantastic.  It was kind of cool to learn how my computer finds the IP address of a website that I want to navigate to.
