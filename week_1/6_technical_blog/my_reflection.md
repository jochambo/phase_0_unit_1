## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://jochambo.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I spent too long on the blog template opting for perfection rather than workable.  Writing the post was not very difficult since it comes pretty naturally for me to judge the utility of a website.  All in all a good exercise and I learned from it.
