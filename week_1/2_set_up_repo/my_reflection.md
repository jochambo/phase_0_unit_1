## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Using [GitHub](https://www.github.com) to create a repository is easy.  Simply log-in using your username and password.  At the top-right of the page you will see your username.  Click on the plus sign to the right of your username and select "New Repository".  Name your repository, select whether you would like it to be public or private and select the option to create a readme document where you will describe the project you are creating.  You are also able to select your license.  To clone the repository, open your GitHub application.  Select your GitHub.com account from the left-side menu and then the repository you just created online.  Click on the option to "Clone" the repository, select the folder on your hard drive where you wish to place it and you are done.

Open source describes the development of software in an environment were code is shared with minimal limits (as defined by licenses).  Not having worked in the software industry, I can only give my opinion that Open Source software has been a great benefit as an end-user.  Most of the software I use that is open source gets frequent updates and I feel is generally more secure.  More eyes have seen the code and on popular projects like Firefox there seem to be fewer bugs.  Obviously, licenses are trying to balance the dual-goals of sharing software for ease of collaboration and attribution for those that give their talents to its development - on a global scale.
