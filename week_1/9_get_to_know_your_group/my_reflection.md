Hi everyone!

First off this feels at little silly sending this to at least one of you, namely, my dear wife Jennie.  But I'm happy to introduce myself and am excited about Dev Bootcamp.  

Here's the basic info we're supposed to share:
Name: Joey Chamberlin

Learning style: Multimodal

I just left the Navy in February after 10+ years and have been serving as a missionary down in Honduras ever since.  Jennie and I just got back to Virginia last Sunday.  We have been planning on DBC since last September, so I'm excited to finally get to meet some other boots.  I totally agree with your blog post, Grace, about being grateful for getting to know our cohort before Day 1 in Chicago.

This week has been a bit tough for Jennie and I with the addition of the Phase 0 pre-requisites.  We left Honduras after 3 months and had planned to have 4 days to get resettled before kicking off with Phase 0 work.  Instead we found ourselves scrambling to complete the 20 Ruby exercises and other assignments that had slipped through the cracks.  Thankfully, we were on track by Tuesday this week.  I think I'll be able to manage each unit's requirements since I'm already able to devote most of my waking hours to this. 

Next week we are doing GPS 1.1 on Wednesday and 1.2 on Friday.  We weren't able to get the other 2 scheduled.  I'm excited to start pairing this week.  My schedule is pretty wide-open, so contact me through Google+ if you would like to meet up.

Looking forward to hearing all of your stories (even you, Jennie :-)

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

This week has been intense and very goal-oriented.  Thankfully as we started reaching the end of the week and the cohort started sharing I realized there was more here than just coding web pages.  The highlight of the week by far was Shareef's talk.  I feel like I need to begin finding some balance of computer time, exercise, family, etc. now so that I'm not easily burnt out during DBC.  I know from experience that balance at any sort of bootcamp is a joke, but it doesn't mean I can't try while I'm still at home.
