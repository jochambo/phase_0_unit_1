* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Designers can be tough to work with.  After college I ended up working for a year as a graphics designer at Kinko's.  Nothing major, mostly business cards and resumes.  But I learned an important lesson there that it can be really hard to communicate design decisions both on the part of the customer and the designer.

I never used wireframing in that job, choosing instead to work straight from my mental picture directly to the computer, but when questions would arise either from a customer or a manager, I found myself frustrated that I didn't have a tool to explain my decisions.

As far as the challenge goes, I enjoyed finding a great wireframing tool (Wirefy) to quickly remove the distractions to understand some of the design decisions that were made.  I'll probably use it in the future to help start to lay out my ideas.
