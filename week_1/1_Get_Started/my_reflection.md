## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Git and I are still getting to know each other a bit.  It's been on my computer for about a year and I can't say we are really acquainted yet.  The biggest problem I ran into with the installation this time around was realizing I had no good way to upgrade to the latest version of git.  I have 1.8.x and I realized there had been an upgrade.  I spent a bit of time trying to find the answer to how and couldn't.  So there was a bit of frustration there.  Ultimately, I made the decision to return another day to the upgrade and use the older version to complete the exercises.  

I found [Stephanie Oh's post](http://stephaniehoh.github.io/blog/2013/10/07/git-vs-github-for-dummies/) amazingly informative.  In it she perfectly distinguishes git as your own local version control system and GitHub as a collaboration zone.  This was key because in all of my tutorials thus far, I've just blindly committed things using git and wondered what use there was in having those commits available on GitHub when I could just access them through git.  

Now I can really understand how any group committed to collaborating can benefit from a local system like git for working out your ideas, testing and implementing them, and a hub where you can introduce your ideas for further scrutiny.  If only companies and even our government worked like this.  

I do look forward to actually using git/GitHub with others.  I still don't quite understand the logistics of multiple branches, merges, and merge conflicts because I just haven't experienced it yet.
