In terms of this being a first go at a solo challenge, I'm satisfied with the final outcome.  The process on the otherhand, well that needs a bit of work.  
I started with an idea about background images.  What if I could combine positioning with a background image containing a 2x2 grid of photos of the seasons to change the background based on a click by the user.  I envisioned a div container that was sized the same as the 1/4th of the background photo.  I would use top-left, etc to position the background.  
All was well until I got to the clicks.  I know there are Javascript ways to do this but we're not there yet so I thought it would be a good challenge.  After hacking away at it for a better part of a day, I went back to my pen and paper design and tried to think up a different method for revealing the four seasons.  After rereading the instructions I realized there might be a way to do it with pseudo-classes.  
The titles became the captions and the sidebar became the intro paragraph.  I spent a lot of time tinkering with the box model and positioning and stumbled upon a few new tricks (like combining sizing and floats to place all four of my photos in a 2x2 grid).
I never could figure out a clean method to place the footer of the sidebar at the bottom of the sidebar.  So if I update the info in the sidebar, the footer will be out of place.  Not optimal to be sure, but I'll make sure I research this.
I am happy that other than syntax questions, I was able to steer clear of any Google cut-and-paste code.  

Add to the blooper reel:  Spending about an hour de-bugging a background image that wouldn't show up.  Opening browsers, closing browsers, turning off computers, wi-fi, nearly asking Starbucks to restart their modem, only to finally realize that I was pointing to the wrong folder.  Foiled by a pair of periods!
